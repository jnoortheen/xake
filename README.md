# xake
It is a build tool that can be used and distributed with projects. This tool does automatic discovery of tasks. Task definitions are parsed by [Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) and the commands are ran using [xonsh](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh). 
All the heavy liftings are done by these libraries.
